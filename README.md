This assignment assesses the following learning outcomes:

LO1	Configure a software project to use framework libraries.
LO2	Design scalable enterprise applications with reusable components.
LO3	Implement advanced data access technologies for a given requirement.

Therefore, it will examine your ability to configure a scalable application, design it following good design practice to ensure reusability of components, and it will access a database – in this assignment, it will be a relational database.

The “Problem”

Microtransactions are a popular way for game developers to increase revenue from games and to spread revenue over a longer period of time than just the sales peak around initial release. You are to develop a microtransaction system for a text-based adventure game called “Kylar’s Vengeance”.
The game’s currency is called the Kubit – players always get some free Kubits to begin with, can earn Kubits through gameplay, or purchase Kubits using real money (e.g. by credit card or Paypal). Each player begins with 1,000 Kubits and 3 pieces of equipment – a sword, a shield and basic armour, all initially at level 1 in terms of upgrades. 
The player has 4 equipment slots: an up-close weapon, a distance weapon, a shield and armour.
The player can upgrade 1 piece of equipment per round of play by purchasing an upgrade. The player can also buy new equipment and sell old equipment, but only once per round of play (1 purchase and 1 sale).
Each piece of equipment has the same set of properties, e.g. damage inflicted, protection provided, and anything else you might think of. For example, at upgrade level 4, a sword could have damage of 40 and protection of 16 (e.g. you can parry with a sword). Perhaps a sword has a maximum damage of 50, while a crossbow might have maximum damage of 65.
